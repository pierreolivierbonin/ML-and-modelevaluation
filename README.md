# ML-and-modelevaluation
This project was part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. It is an analysis of past loans and predicting whether an individual is likely to pay it off or not. It includes several techniques of machine learning as well as basic ETL and data visualization operations.

*Libraries used:* sci-kit learn, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn

*Machine learning techniques applied:*
* K Nearest Neihbour (KNN)
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Support Vector Machine
* Logistic Regression

*Model Evaluation (based on train-test split method) and indicators used:*
* Jaccard index
* F1-score
* LogLoss

*ETL operations included:*
* loading dataset
* converting date time object
* converting categorical features to numerical values
* outputting normalized values of a distribution (% instead of absolute values)
* converting categorical variables to binary variables
* normalizing the data of the features selected for machine learning models

*Data visualization and exploratory analysis included:*
* Seaborn FacetGrid (multiple histograms in a single figure)
* subsample comparison
* visualization of the accuracy of a KNN model according to their K
