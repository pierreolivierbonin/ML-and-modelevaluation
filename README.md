# ML-and-modelevaluation
This project was part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. It includes several techniques of machine learning as well as basic ETL and data visualization operations.

*Machine learning techniques applied:*
* K Nearest Neihbour (KNN)
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Support Vector Machine
* Logistic Regression

*Model Evaluation (based on train-test split method) and indicators used:*
* Jaccard index
* F1-score
* LogLoss

*ETL operations included:*
* loading dataset
* converting date time object
* converting categorical features to numerical values
* outputting normalized values of a distribution (% instead of absolute values)
* converting categorical variables to binary variables
* normalizing the data of the features selected for machine learning models

*Data visualization and exploratory analysis included:*
* Seaborn FacetGrid (multiple histograms in a single figure)
* subsample comparison
* visualization of the accuracy of a KNN model according to their K
